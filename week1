Q1. Create one variable containing following type of data:
(i) string -i="santosh"
(ii) list  l=[23,251,26,85,530.3]
(iii) float a=2.0
(iv) tuple t=(10,20,"hello")


Q2. Given are some following variables containing data:
What will be the data type of the below given variable.
(i) var1 = ‘ ‘
ans:- string
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’
ans:-invalid character
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ]
ans:- list
(iv) var4 = 1.
ans:-integer

Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) /
ans:-Division 
print(10/2)=5
(ii) %
ans:-modulus gives remainder
print(10%3)=1
(iii) //
ans:-Floor divison gives quotient
print(10//3)=3
(iv) **
ans:-exponents means sqaure of the integers
print(5**2)=25


Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the
element and its data type.
ans:-L=[10,20,30,40.3,'santosh','subham','sonu',98,62,88]
for i in L:
    print(type(i))
<class 'int'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'int'>


Q5. Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how many
times it can be divisible.
ans:-
a=int (input ())
b=int (input ())
while a%b==0: 
    print ('a is divisible by b', 'and a is divisible by b for', a/b, 'times')
    break 
else:
    print ('a is not divisible by b')
40
10
a is divisible by b and a is divisible by b for 4.0 times



Q6. Create a list containing 25 int type data. Using for loop and if-else condition print if the element is
divisible by 3 or not.
ans:-
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]
type(a)
list

for i in a:
    if i%3==0:
        print(i, 'is divisible by 3')
    else:
            print(i, 'is not divisible by 3')
output
1 is not divisible by 3
2 is not divisible by 3
3 is divisible by 3
4 is not divisible by 3
5 is not divisible by 3
6 is divisible by 3
7 is not divisible by 3
8 is not divisible by 3
9 is divisible by 3
10 is not divisible by 3
11 is not divisible by 3
12 is divisible by 3
13 is not divisible by 3
14 is not divisible by 3
15 is divisible by 3
16 is not divisible by 3
17 is not divisible by 3
18 is divisible by 3
19 is not divisible by 3
20 is not divisible by 3
21 is divisible by 3
22 is not divisible by 3
23 is not divisible by 3
24 is divisible by 3
25 is not divisible by 3


Q7. What do you understand about mutable and immutable data types? Give examples for both showing
this property.
ans:-mutable data type:-
mutable object can change its state or contents.
example:-
list,dictionary,byte array

immutable data type:- immutable object cannot change its state or contents.
example:-int,float,complex,string,tuple,set.
